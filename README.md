I unfortunately didn't quite make it to Step 6 so I guess I'll just describe how the ball shooting set up is a game.
One of the key points consistently brought up during class is that a game should have rules and goals of some sort.
The ball shooting doesn't have any extrinsic rewards to serve as a goal. However, it does have an intrinsic reward: the satisfaction of hitting the target in the center.
I'm not quite sure why hitting a bullseye is satisfying, maybe its because it has the smallest surface area so makes you feel precise?
The ball shooting does have rules, mainly you are restricted to where your balls launch from.

I think if I were to make my own game setup in Stetp 6, I would change the target of ball game. Maybe turn it into a cup or some sort.
So rather than trying to hit a bullseye, the player trys to shoot the ball into the cup.
